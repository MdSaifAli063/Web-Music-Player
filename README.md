## 🎨 Customize

Colors and Theme

All theme variables live at the top of css/style.css under :root. Tweak these to quickly change the look:

```bash
:root {
  --bg: #0b0c0e;
  --text: #e8f3e8;
  --primary: #1db954; /* green accent */
  --border: #23282d;
  /* ... */
}
```

- Brand and Icons
- Brand wordmark is a styled text element in index.html: Playify
- Icons use Material Symbols Rounded (Google Fonts). You can switch icons by changing their text content, e.g.: shuffle
- Add Your Songs
- Open js/script.js and edit the tracks array:

```bash
const tracks = [
  {
    id: "my-1",
    title: "My First Track",
    artist: "Me",
    src: "https://your.cdn.example.com/audio/my-track.mp3",
    cover: "https://your.cdn.example.com/covers/my-cover.jpg",
    duration: null, // keep null; it will auto-fill from metadata
  },
  // ...
];
```

Then optionally add your track IDs to a playlist in playlists:

```bash
const playlists = [
  {
    id: "pl-custom",
    title: "My Mix",
    desc: "Handpicked favorites.",
    cover: "https://your.cdn.example.com/covers/mix.jpg",
    trackIds: ["my-1", "qodo-2", "qodo-3"],
  },
];
```
No extra wiring needed: the UI will render playlists and durations automatically.

## 🧭 Files Overview

- index.html — semantic layout, Material Symbols, and basic structure
- css/style.css — refined black/green theme, controls, responsive sidebar, accessible focus
- js/script.js — Audio element setup, playlist rendering, queue management, seek, volume, repeat/shuffle, likes

## 🧩 Implementation Notes

- Audio is driven by a single HTMLAudioElement with JS event listeners
- Likes and volume are persisted with localStorage keys:
- playify_likes
- playify_volume
- Repeat supports three modes: off → all → one
- Sidebar becomes an off‑canvas drawer under 1024px (hamburger to open, close button inside)

🧪 Troubleshooting

Audio won’t start automatically: Most browsers block autoplay with sound. Click the Play button once.
Icons look like empty squares: Ensure you have the Material Symbols link in the head and an active internet connection.
Green accents look too strong: Reduce --primary or remove subtle green mixes on hover in css/style.css.
